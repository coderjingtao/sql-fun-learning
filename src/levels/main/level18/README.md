## 18. Grouping & Aggregation - Multi-Field Grouping


### Tutorial
Sometimes, single-field grouping cannot meet our needs. For example, if we want to count the student participation in each exam for each class in a school, we can use multi-field grouping.

The implementation of multi-field grouping is almost identical to single-field grouping, just use the `GROUP BY` syntax.



### Example
Assume there is an orders table `orders`, containing the following fields: `order_id`, `product_id`, `customer_id`, `amount`.

Data as follows:

| order_id | product_id | customer_id | amount |
|---------|-------------|--------|---------|
| 1       | 1      | A001        | 100    |
| 2       | 1      | A002        | 200    |
| 3       | 1      | A001        | 150    |
| 4       | 1      | A003        | 50     |
| 5 | 2 | A001 | 50 |



To query the total amount of **each product** purchased by **each customer** in the table using multi-field grouping, this is equivalent to grouping by customer ID and product ID:

```sql
-- Query the total amount of each product purchased by each user, grouped by customer ID and product ID
SELECT customer_id, product_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id, product_id;
```



Query result:

| customer_id | product_id | total_amount |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| A001        | 1          | 250          |
| A001        | 2          | 50           |
| A002        | 1          | 200          |
| A003        | 1          | 50           |



### Exercise

Assume there is a student table `student`, containing the following fields: `id` (student ID), `name` (name), `class_id` (class ID), `exam_num` (exam number), `score` (score). Please write an SQL query to count the class ID (class_id), exam number (exam_num), and the total number of students participating in each exam for each class (total_num) in the student table.
